- Includes recent releases and classics
- Always available as fallback

## Architecture

- **Component Structure**: Main `SciFiTracker` component with extracted `MovieCard`
- **State Management**: React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`)

- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom utilities and animations

## Deployment

The app is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions:

- **Automatic Deployment**: Every push to the `main` branch triggers a new deployment
- **Build Process**: Uses Node.js 18 and npm ci for consistent builds
- **Environment Variables**: TMDB API key is securely stored as a GitHub secret
- **GitHub Pages**: Deployed using the official GitHub Pages actions

### Manual Deployment

You can also deploy manually using:
```bash
npm run deploy
```
